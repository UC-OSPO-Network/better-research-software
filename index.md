This repository contains a short (2-day) course teaching tools and practices for producing and sharing quality, sustaiable and [FAIR 
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) research software][fair-software] to support open and reproducible research. 

## Target Audience

- Post-graduate students or early career researchers who are starting their research projects and want to develop software to support their research using established best practices
- Researchers who had foundational software training before but wish to refresh, reinforce or improve their skills and practices in the wider context of FAIR research and sharing and writing software for open and reproducible research 


## Learning Objectives

After attending this training, you will be able to:

- List challenges typically faced by researchers developing software and managing data for modern computational research, including requirements commensurate with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoprable, Reusable) principles
- List some tools and practices that can help make your research, data and software open and FAIR
- Automate your research and enable replication of your research results by writing software to implement the research methodology
- Share and version control your software using Git and GitHub
- List best practices for developing and sharing opena and sustainable software (including writing readable code, code documentation, licencing and citation)
- Assess if the code does what it intends to do
- List tools and techniques for collaborative and sustainable software development and maintenance

## Prerequisites

Before joining this training, participants should have foundational knowledge of Python or another programming language used to write scientific code. 
For example, attending a [Software Carpentry][swc-lessons]/[Data Carpentry][dc-lessons]/[Library Carpentry][lc-lessons] or a similar introductory Python course could help with this requirement and 
ganing necesssary prerequisite skills.
