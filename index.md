This repository contains a short (2-day) course teaching tools and practices for producing and sharing quality and [FAIR 
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) research software][fair-software] to support open and reproducible research. 


## Target Audience

- Post-graduate students or early career researchers who are starting their research projects and want to develop software to support their research using established best practices
- Researchers who had foundational software training before but wish to refresh, reinforce or improve their skills and practices in the wider context of FAIR research and sharing and writing software for open and reproducible research 


## Learning Objectives

After attending this training, participants will:

- Understand challenges typically faced by researchers developing software and managing data for modern computational research, including requirements commensurate with the FAIR principles
- Know the tools and practices to make their research, data and software open and FAIR wherever possible for reuse / repurpose
- Understand how to automate their research and help replicate their research results by writing software to implement the research methodology
- Apply a version control to back up and share software using GitHub
- Undestand and apply best practices for developing and sharing sustainable software (including writing readable code, code documentation, licencing and citation)
- Know how assess if the code does what it intends to
- Recognise tools and techniques for collaborative software development and maintainance

## Prerequisites

Before joining this training, participants should have foundational knowledge of Python or another programming language used to write scientific code. 
For example, attending a [Software Carpentry][swc-lessons]/[Data Carpentry][dc-lessons]/[Library Carpentry][lc-lessons] or a similar introductory Python course could help with this requirement and 
ganing necesssary prerequisite skills.
