This is a training curriculum teaching tools and practices to help reseachers produce and share 
open and quality software for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) research.

## Learning Objectives

After attending this training, participants will:

- Understand challenges typically faced by researchers developing software for modern computational research, including requirements for research software commensurate with the FAIR principles
- Know the tools and practices to make their research, data and software open and FAIR wherever possible for reuse / repurpose
- Understand how to automate their research and help replicate their research results by writing software to implement the research methodology
- Know how to backup and version control their software using GitHub
- Know how to develop software (code, documentation, licencing, packaging, citation) for someone else (including themselves 6 months down the line)
- Know how to ensure the code does what it intends to do and continues to be fit for purpose
- Know how to collaboratively develop and maintain software

## Prerequisites

Before joining this training, participants should have foundational knowledge of Python or another programming language used to write scientific code. 
For example, attending a [Software Carpentry][swc]/[Data Carpentry][dc]/[Library Carpentry][lc] or a similar introductory Python course could help with this requirement and 
ganing necesssary prerequisite skills.
