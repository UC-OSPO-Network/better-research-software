This short course is teaching tools and practices for producing and sharing quality, 
sustainable and [FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) research software][fair-principles-research-software] 
to support **open and reproducible research**. 
The course can be delivered over 2 full or 4 half days.

## Target audience

- Post-graduate students, early career researchers or junior Research Software Engineers (RSEs) who are starting their research or software projects, 
have foundational knowledge of Python, version control and using software tools from command line shell, and want to develop 
software to support their research using established best practices
- Researchers or scientists who had foundational software training before but wish to refresh, 
reinforce or improve their skills and practices in the wider context of FAIR research and sharing and writing 
software for open and reproducible research 

Check out a few example [learner profiles](./profiles.html), to see if this course is a right fit for you.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  prereq

## Prerequisites

Before joining this training, participants **must** have foundational knowledge of Python 
used to write scientific code, version control system Git and a command line (shell) tool to be able to
understand code examples used in the course.

Attending a [Software Carpentry][swc-lessons] or a similar course could help with these requirements and
gaining necessary prerequisite skills.

Please also make sure you have [all the required software](../index.html#setup) installed before attending this course.

## Learning objectives

After attending this training, you **will be able** to:

- List challenges typically faced by researchers developing software (and managing data) for modern computational, 
reproducible research, including those commensurate with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles
- Build on top of your existing knowledge of Python, Git and command line tools to enhance your research
software development workflow with some good open and reproducible research software practices around 
structuring, writing, documenting, testing, sharing and reusing code (including software licencing and citation)

## What we do not teach 

This course assumes the prior knowledge of and does not focus on teaching:

- Python code syntax or skills (even though Python is used in code examples) 
- the basic Git workflow
- how to navigate file systems, manipulate files and invoke Python scripts and tools from a command line terminal/shell.
