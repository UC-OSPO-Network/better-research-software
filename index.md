This is a training curriculum teaching tools and practices to help reseachers produce and share 
open and quality software for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) research.

## Target Audience

- Post-graduate students or early career researchers who are starting their research projects and want to develop software to support their research using established best practices
- Researchers who had foundational software training before but wish to refresh, reinforce or improve their skills and practices in the wider context of FAIR research and sharing and writing software for open and reproducible research 


## Learning Objectives

After attending this training, participants will:

- Understand challenges typically faced by researchers developing software for modern computational research, including requirements for research software commensurate with the FAIR principles
- Know the tools and practices to make their research, data and software open and FAIR wherever possible for reuse / repurpose
- Understand how to automate their research and help replicate their research results by writing software to implement the research methodology
- Know how to backup and version control their software using GitHub
- Know how to develop software (code, documentation, licencing, packaging, citation) for someone else (including themselves 6 months down the line)
- Know how to ensure the code does what it intends to do and continues to be fit for purpose
- Know how to collaboratively develop and maintain software

## Prerequisites

Before joining this training, participants should have foundational knowledge of Python or another programming language used to write scientific code. 
For example, attending a [Software Carpentry][swc-lessons]/[Data Carpentry][dc-lessons]/[Library Carpentry][lc-lessons] or a similar introductory Python course could help with this requirement and 
ganing necesssary prerequisite skills.
