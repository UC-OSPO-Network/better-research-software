This short course is teaching tools and practices for producing and sharing quality, 
sustainable and [FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) research software][fair-principles-research-software] 
to support open and reproducible research. 
The course can be delivered over 2 full or 4 half days.

## Target Audience

- Post-graduate students or early career researchers who are starting their research projects and want to develop software to support their research using established best practices
- Researchers or scientists who had foundational software training before but wish to refresh, reinforce or improve their skills and practices in the wider context of FAIR research and sharing and writing software for open and reproducible research 

Check out a few example [learner profiles](./profiles.html), to see if this course is a right fit for you.

## Learning Objectives

After attending this training, you will be able to:

- List challenges typically faced by researchers developing software and managing data for modern computational 
research, including those commensurate with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles
- Understand and use some tools and practices that can help make your research, data and software FAIR
- Automate your research and enable replication of your research results by writing software to implement the 
research methodology and assess if the code does what it intends to do via code testing
- Share and version control your research software using Git and GitHub
- Use best practices for developing FAIR research software - including writing readable code, 
code documentation, licencing and citation
- Use tools and techniques for collaborative and sustainable open software development and maintenance
- Understand some ethical issues around research software development and usage and how our work impacts others

## Prerequisites

Before joining this training, participants should have foundational knowledge of Python or another programming 
language used to write scientific code, Git and a command line (shell) tool. While we are not focussing on teaching you to code in Python or write Command Line tool scripts, we will be using code
and command examples and will be teaching you how to use these tools in combination to make your research and 
work more automated and reproducible so basic understanding would be very beneficial. 
Attending a [Software Carpentry][swc-lessons] or a similar course could help with these requirements and 
gaining necessary prerequisite skills. 

Some of our code examples use the Python library `Pandas` for manipulating data frames.
Familiarity with this library and it's [apply() method](pandas-apply-docs) would be beneficial.    

Please also make sure you have the [required software](../index.html#setup) installed before attending this course.
