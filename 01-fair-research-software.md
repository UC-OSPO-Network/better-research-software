:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Open research means the outputs of publicly funded research are publicly accessible with no or minimal restrictions.
- Reproducible research means the data and software is available to recreate the analysis.
- FAIR data and software is:
  - Findable
  - Accessible
  - Interoperable
  - Reusable
- These principles support research and researchers by saving time, reducing barriers to discovery, and increasing impact of the research output.
