## Icebreaker discussion

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Why have you attended this course? Is it by your own choice or did someone advise you to come?

What do you want to learn or change in your current research software work? Describe how your knowledge, work or attitude will be different afterwards.

## The purpose of this course

## What is open, reproducible research?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

- What do you understand by the words:
  - Reproducible research?
  - Open research?

- How many people or groups can you list that might benefit from your work being open and reproducible?

## FAIR software

FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable and comprises a set of principles designed to
increase the visibility and usefulness of your research to others.
The FAIR data principles [ref] are widely known and applied today.
Similar FAIR principles [ref] have now been defined for software too. In general, they mean:

* **Findable** - software and its associated metadata must be easy to discover by humans and machines alike.
* **Accessible** - in order to reuse software, software and its metadata must be retrievable.
* **Interoperable** - when interacting with other software it must be done by exchanging data and/or metadata through
  standardised protocols and application programming interfaces (APIs).
* **Reusable** - software should be usable (can be executed) and reusable
  (can be understood, modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software).

Each of the above principles can be achieved by a number of practices listed below.
This is not exact science, and by all means the list below is not exhaustive,
but any of the practices that you employ to your research software methodology will bring you
closer to the gold standard of a fully reproducible research.
(Also check out the following ["10 easy things to make your research software FAIR"](https://librarycarpentry.org/Top-10-FAIR/files/poster_10things_FAIRsoftware.pdf
).)

* Findable
  * Create a description of your software
  * Place your software in a software repository (and ideally register it in a software registry)
  * Use a unique and persistent identifier for your software (also useful for citations)
* Accessible
  * Make sure people can download your software
* Interoperable
  * Explain the functionality of your software
  * Use standard formats for inputs and outputs
  * Communicate with other software via standard protocols and APIs
* Reusable
  * Document your software (including its functionality, and how to install and run it)
  * Follow best practices for software development (including coding conventions, code readability and verifying its correctness)
  * Give a licence to your software clearly stating how it can be reused
  * State how to cite your software

We are going to explore the above practices on an example software project we will be working on as part of this
course.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Open research means the outputs of publicly funded research are publicly accessible with no or minimal restrictions.
- Reproducible research means the data and software is available to recreate the analysis.
- FAIR data and software is:
  - Findable
  - Accessible
  - Interoperable
  - Reusable
- These principles support research and researchers by saving time, reducing barriers to discovery, and increasing impact of the research output.
