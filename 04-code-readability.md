:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Readable code is easier to understand, maintain, debug and extend!
- Creating functions from the smallest, reusable units of code will help compartmentalise which parts of the code are doing what actions
- Choosing descriptive variable and function names will communicate their purpose more effectively
- Using inline comments and docstrings to describe parts of the code will help transmit understanding, and verify that the code is correct
