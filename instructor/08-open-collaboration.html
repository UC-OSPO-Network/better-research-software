<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="copyright-licenses">Copyright Licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#copyright-licenses"></a></h3>
<p>The authors of any creative work such as written text, photographs,
films, music and computer code are protected by Copyright law. This
allows them to set the terms under which their work can be copied or
reproduced. This often takes the form of the creator of the work selling
copies of it and receiving a fee from each person who obtains a copy.
Those receiving the copies are typically forbidden from making
additional copies without the permission of the creator. For example if
an author writes a book they will receive some money for each copy of
that book that’s sold and anybody who makes and sells a copy of that
book would need their permission to do so.</p>
<p>Copyright licenses don’t necessarily require any money to be charged
for copies and the creator might choose to let anybody copy their work,
providing they don’t change it and keep their name on it.</p>
<p>Copyright is automatically implied, any creative work which doesn’t
specify a license should be assumed to be copyrighted. If it were ever
to come to a court case then the author might have a problem proving
this and enforcing their copyright. Technically the work is copyrighted
the moment it is created, even without any kind of copyright statement,
registration or license agreement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="copyright-and-open-source">Copyright and Open Source<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#copyright-and-open-source"></a></h3>
<p>An Open Source license is a form of copyright license that gives
anybody who receives a copy of a work the right to make additional
copies and distribute them to anybody else. It also allows anybody who
receives a copy to make changes to the original work and to redistribute
those. When applied to software this usually requires that anybody
supplying the executable binary of a program must also supply the source
code if requested.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="copyright-statements">Copyright Statements<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#copyright-statements"></a></h3>
<p>A common way to declare your copyright of a program and the license
you are distributing it under is to include a file called LICENSE in
your code repository, to display it in comments in a code file or to
display it on screen when the program is run. At the very least each
source file should state what license the code is under and tell the
reader to refer to the LICENSE file. This means that if the code ever
gets (accidentally) redistributed without the license file then the
reader will still know about the license that was used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="free-software">Free Software<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#free-software"></a></h3>
<p>In the early history of computing there were often informal
agreements where programmers would share source code with each other,
but this was rarely backed up with any formal copyright license. As the
field grew this was first formalised in the 1980s by Richard Stallman
who formed the Free Software Foundation and defined “Free Software” as
software which which respects users freedoms by granting them four
freedoms:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does
your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition
for this.</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your
neighbor.</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition
for this.</li>
</ol><p>The term “Free” in English often causes some confusion here as it can
mean both “free as in freedom” and “free as in beer” (no charge). The
term “Libre” software is sometimes used instead of “Free” to help
clarify this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="open-source-definition">Open Source Definition<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#open-source-definition"></a></h3>
<p>In the 1990s the “Open Source” movement wanted to make a more
business friendly term and thought using the term “Free” might lead to
confusion when people wanted to charge for software. Despite “Free
Software” often being given away for no charge (or just a small
charge/suggested donation to cover media or distribution costs), nothing
in the four freedoms and the software licenses that were designed around
it prohibits charging for software.</p>
<p>In 1998 the Open Source Definition was created and says that software
which is open source must be distributed under the a license which
allows the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Free Redistribution must be allowed</li>
<li>Source Code must be included</li>
<li>Derived Works must be allowed</li>
<li>Integrity of The Author’s Source Code - There can only be
restrictions on the distribution of modifications if patches can be
distributed instead. Must explicitly permit distribution of software
built from modified source code. The license may require derived works
to carry a different name or version number from the original
software.</li>
<li>No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</li>
<li>No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</li>
<li>Distribution of License - License applies to anyone the software is
distributed to</li>
<li>License Must Not Be Specific to a Product - the program can be
extracted from other software it is distributed with</li>
<li>License Must Not Restrict Other Software, e.g. can’t insist it is
only distributed alongside other open source software.</li>
<li>License Must Be Technology-Neutral</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="free-and-open-source-software">Free and Open Source Software<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#free-and-open-source-software"></a></h3>
<p>Because of these two terms many people use the term “Free and Open
Source Software” (FOSS), while other’s simple say “Open Source Software”
and some will say “Free Software”. In reality these all have very
similar meanings that will respect the four freedoms and the open source
definition. For the rest of this chapter we will refer to “Open Source”,
but could have equally said “Free and Open Source Software” or “Free
Software”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="types-of-licenses">Types of licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-licenses"></a></h2>
<p>A number licenses have been written that conform to the Four Freedoms
and/or the Open Source definition. Each of these set out the rights of
anybody receiving software that is distributed under that license. We
will look at a few of the most popular ones.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="public-domain">Public Domain<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#public-domain"></a></h3>
<p>Before we look at any licenses in detail, one other thing to consider
is Public Domain. This is a concept in some countries (but not all)
where a work is not protected by copyright. These works have no license
from their creators and typically anybody can do anything they like with
them. Copyrights are usually time limited to between 50 and 100 years
and in many jurisdictions when Copyrights expire the works enter the
public domain. It is for this reason that the works of Charles Dickens
are no longer subject to Copyright and anybody can make a copy of them.
In some jurisdictions works can be placed straight into the public
domain simply with a declaration within the work. In the USA works
produced by the federal government are automatically public domain. But
in other countries works need to be registered as public domain. For
this reason it isn’t recommended to simply make work public domain if
you want to release it for use across the world.</p>
<p>If you really want to release code under something very similar to
public domain then the <a href="https://unlicense.org/" class="external-link">unlicense</a>
could be for you. It states that anybody is free to use the software in
any way they like. In jurisdictions with public domain, it “dedicates”
the software into the public domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="permissive-licenses">Permissive Licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#permissive-licenses"></a></h3>
<p>Some of the simplest open source licenses are known as the
“permissive licenses”. Broadly speaking these require anybody
redistributing the code to include the license text and a copyright
statement crediting the authors. But they do not require any
modifications to release their source code alongside the executable
program. This allows software released under these licenses to be made
into part of a closed source program and all the creator of the closed
source program needs to do is distribute the license text and perhaps
some crediting statement to the original author, but they don’t need to
redistribute the source code with their closed source program.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="mit-license">MIT License<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mit-license"></a></h4>
<p>The MIT License is very simple and a very popular choice of license,
it is only three paragraphs long. It states that:</p>
<ul><li>Anybody receiving the software can copy, modify, merge, publish,
distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software to anybody
they like.</li>
<li>That they must include the license text and copyright statement when
they redistribute it.</li>
<li>That there’s no warranty included and you can’t hold the authors
liable for any problems or damages that might arise.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="bsd">BSD<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bsd"></a></h4>
<p>The BSD license is very similar to the MIT license, but it has
several variants. The oldest is the 4 clause version which requires:</p>
<ul><li>Source code redistributions must include the copyright statement and
license text.</li>
<li>Binary redistributions must include the copyright notice and license
text in their documentation.</li>
<li>Any advertising for the software incorporating this software must
include a statement saying that it includes software written by the
author.</li>
<li>That the author doesn’t endorse any derived products.</li>
<li>That the author doesn’t provide a warranty. (this is written in a
separate section and isn’t one of the 4 clauses)</li>
</ul><p>The acknowledgement/advertising clause caused some controversy and
some people thought that it didn’t meet the open source definition or
comply with the four freedoms. It also became impractical and lead to
very long statements where there were multiple authors of large pieces
of software.</p>
<p>To address this a new version of the license known as the 3 clause
BSD license was created. This removed the acknowledgement clause. An
even simpler 2 clause version removes the endorsement clause.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="apache-2-0">Apache 2.0<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#apache-2-0"></a></h4>
<p>Another popular permissive license is the Apache 2.0 license. It is
very similar to the MIT and BSD licenses, but also includes some clauses
about patent licensing. These require any contributor to a program which
is licensed under Apache 2.0 to allow their patents to be used free of
charge by any user of the software. This was done to head off some
concerns about software patent legislation at the time the license was
developed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="copyleft-licenses">Copyleft Licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#copyleft-licenses"></a></h3>
<p>The other common form of open source licenses are the “Copyleft”
licenses. These require that any modifications to the program are also
released under a compatible copyleft license. This can cause
complications when combining code that’s under copyleft with other
licenses as now the entire codebase must be released under the copyleft
license. If there are any incompatible terms in the other license then
this can prevent the two codebases from being combined.</p>
<p>The main advantage of copyleft licenses is that anybody else who
incorporates the code into another product must also keep that product
open and this makes it harder for it to be subsumed into a commercial
product that doesn’t contribute improvements to the code back to the
community which created it.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="gpl-version-2">GPL version 2<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#gpl-version-2"></a></h4>
<p>The mostly commonly known copyleft license is the GNU Public License
or GPL. There are several versions of the GPL available, the oldest GPL
version 1.0, but this version was quickly replaced with version 2.0 and
was rarely used. Version 2 is much more common and is used by a lot of
popular software including the Linux Kernel. Compared with the
permissive license the GPL is quite a long license agreement and many of
its clauses can be quite difficult for non-lawyers to fully
understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="gpl-version-3">GPL version 3<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#gpl-version-3"></a></h4>
<p>The GPL version 3 was introduced to try and prevent patenting of
software under the license and to require that people distributing GPL
code on embedded systems must also give users the ability to rebuild
that software and use it in their device. It is an even longer document
than GPL version 2 and has proved controversial with some and despite
coming out in 2007 hasn’t been adopted by many projects which used GPL
version 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="lgpl">LGPL<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lgpl"></a></h4>
<p>In order to allow library software to be combined with (“linked” in
technical terms) other software that is not GPLed, a special version of
the GPL called the LGPL (L for “Lesser” or “Library”) was created. This
is used by many popular libraries including the GNU C library that is
linked to every C program compiled on a Linux system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="agpl">AGPL<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#agpl"></a></h4>
<p>One problem for the GPL is that a lot of modern software doesn’t run
on user’s own computers, but on remote web servers that they connect to
through their web browser. When a user run’s one of these web
applications they aren’t receiving a copy of the software’s executable
binaries, but are interacting with them over a computer network such as
the internet. This doesn’t meet the GPL’s definition of distributing the
binaries, so even if the web application is under the GPL, the person
running the server has no obligation to supply users with the source
code. The Affero GPL or AGPL requires that people running web
applications licensed under the AGPL make the source code available to
the users of those web applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="choosing-a-license">Choosing a License<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choosing-a-license"></a></h3>
<p>When choosing a license for your code there’s a number of things you
might want to consider:</p>
<ul><li>Do you want to ensure that anybody modifying and redistributing your
code will release the source code of their changes?</li>
<li>Or would you prefer to ensure the least number of restrictions and
that your code will be used as widely as possible? Even if that means it
might end up in commercial products that don’t release their source
code.</li>
<li>Are you reusing code which is already under an open source license?
What obligations do you have under those licenses?</li>
<li>Is there a preferred license in your research community?</li>
</ul><p>Don’t be tempted to write you’re own license (or modify an existing
one) unless you are a copyright lawyer. The common open source licenses
have been carefully written by copyright lawyers, many of them have
undergone multiple iterations in response to cases that have arisen and
the implications of many different legal jurisidcitons has been
considered. The common licenses are also well known, meaning that
potential users and contributors have a better understanding of what
their rights and responsibilities are leaving less room for
misunderstanding.</p>

<h3 id="creative-commons-licenses">Creative Commons Licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creative-commons-licenses"></a></h3>
<p>All of the licenses we’ve discussed so far are really only intended
for source code. They are not suitable for documentation, datasets,
drawings, logos, music, maps etc. To solve this problem there are the
Creative Commons licenses, which are expressly built for anything other
than source code. Creative commons has now gone through four versions
with the latest being version 4.0, generally you should use version 4.0
as this is more suited for use around the world</p>
<p>There are several different types of Creative Commons licenses:</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="cc0">CC0<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cc0"></a></h4>

<h3 id="license-compatibility">License Compatibility<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#license-compatibility"></a></h3>
<p>Generally, you can relicense someone else’s code under more
permissive licenses to less permissive ones without their permission.
For example, you could relicense code from the MIT license to the GPL.
This is because nothing in the GPL contradicts anything in the MIT
license, but you’ll still have to display the MIT license for the
original code and the GPL for your modifications.</p>
<p>This doesn’t work the other way though, you can’t take code released
under GPL and relicense it as MIT since MIT is a more liberal license
that doesn’t match the terms of the GPL.</p>
<p>Creative commons zero or public domain code can usually be relicensed
to any open source license (or a commercial license for that
matter).</p>
<p>Sometimes there are contradictory statements in licenses which
prevent relicensing. For example Apache 2 has some provisions about
software patents, you won’t be able to relicense Apache 2 code under MIT
since it doesn’t have an equivalent patent clause.</p>
<p>The GNU project has a [useful guide][gnu-license-guide] to license
compatibility on their website.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="getting-agreement-to-relicense">Getting agreement to relicense<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#getting-agreement-to-relicense"></a></h3>
<p>Sometimes the developers of a program will wish to change the license
it is distributed under. In order to do this they’ll need the agreement
of all the copyright holders of the program and typically this will mean
everyone who contributed code to it. This is fine if you only have a
handful of contributors to your project, but gets harder when the
project starts to grow bigger.</p>
<p>Some projects work around this by having contributors agree to a
“contributor license agreement”. This will set out the terms under which
the code is contributed to the project. It might include a copyright
assignment or just granting certain rights to the project. This usually
allows the company (or non-profit foundation as many open source
projects are based on non-profit foundations) running the project to
relicense the code in future and to take legal action against people who
violate the license.</p>

<p>It is possible to sell software that is licensed under an open source
license commercially, you will need to supply the source code along with
the binaries. However, under any license meeting the Open Source
Definition or the Four Freedoms the person receiving the software can
make copies and give (or sell) them to anybody else.</p>
<p>It is also possible to release software under two licenses, one open
source and one commercial. This has been done by a few open source
projects who wish to sell the software to some customers (sometimes with
extra custom modifications) and give it to others.</p>

<p>By default repositories created on Github are private and only their
creator can see them. If we’re going to be adding an open source license
to our repository we probably want to make sure people can actually
access it too!</p>
<p>Go to the Github webpage of your repository
(<code>https://github.com/&lt;yourusername&gt;/&lt;yourrepsoitoryname&gt;</code>)
and click on the Settings link near the top right corner. Then scroll
down to the bottom of the page and the “Danger Zone” settings. Click on
“Change Visibility” and you should see a message saying “Change to
public”, if it says “Change to private” then the repository is already
public. You’ll then be asked to confirm that you want to make the
repository public and agree to the warning that the code will now be
publicly visible. As a security measure you’ll then have to put in your
Github password.</p>

<p>Currently our repository is under the Github “namespace” of our
individual user. This is ok for individual projects where we are the
sole or at least main author, but for bigger and more complex projects
it is common to use a Github organisation named after our project. If we
are a member of an organisation and have the appropriate permissions
then we can transfer a repository from our personal namespace to the
organisation’s. This can be done with another option in the “Danger
Zone” settings, the “Transfer ownership” button. Pressing this will then
prompt us as to which organisation we want to transfer the repository
to.</p>

<p>Zenodo is a data archive run by CERN. Anybody can upload datasets up
to 50GB to it and receive a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Zenodo’s
definition of a dataset is quite broad and can include code. This gives
us a way to obtain a DOI for our code. We can archive our Github
repository to Zenodo by doing the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Go to the <a href="https://zenodo.org/login" class="external-link">Zenodo Login page</a>
and choose to login with Github.</li>
<li>Authorise Zenodo to connect to Github.</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/" class="external-link">Github page</a> in
your Zenodo account. This can be found in the pull down menu with your
user name in the top right corner of the screen.</li>
<li>You’ll now have a list of all of your Github repositories. Next to
each will be an “On” button. If you have created a new repository you
might need to press the “Sync” button to update the list of repositories
Zenodo knows about.</li>
<li>Press the “On” button for the repository you want to archive. If
this was successful you’ll be told to refresh the page.</li>
<li>The repository should now appear in the list of Enabled repositories
at the top of the screen. But it doesn’t yet have a DOI. To get one we
have to make a release on Github. Click on the repository and then press
the green button to create a release. This will take you to Github’s
release page where you’ll be asked to give a title and description of
the release. You will also have to create a tag, this is a way of having
a friendly name for the version of some code in Git instead of using a
long hash code. Often we’ll create a sequential version number for each
release of the software and have the tag name match this, for example
v1.0 or just 1.0.</li>
<li>If we now refresh the Zenodo page for this repository we will see
that it has been assigned a DOI.</li>
</ol><p>The DOI doesn’t just link to Github, Zenodo will have taken a copy of
our repository at the point where we tagged the release. This means that
even if we delete it from Github or even if Github were ever to go away
or remove it, they’ll still be a copy on Zenodo. Zenodo will allow
people to download the entire repository as a single Zip file.</p>
<p>Zenodo will have actually created two DOIs for you. One represents
the latest version of the software and will always represent the latest
if you make more releases. The other is specfic to the release you made
and will always point to that version. We can see both of these by
clicking on the DOI link in the Zenodo page for the repository. One of
the things which is displayed on this page is a badge image that you can
copy the link for and add to the README file in your Git repository so
that people can find the Zenodo version of the repository. If you click
on the DOI image in the Details section of the Zenodo page then you will
be shown instructions for obtaining a link to the DOI badge in various
formats including Markdown. Here is the badge for this repository and
the corresponding Markdown:</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11869450" class="external-link"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11869450.svg" alt="DOI" class="figure"></a></p>

<p>The strength of online collaboration tools such as Github doesn’t

<h2 id="tracking-issues-with-code">Tracking Issues with Code<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tracking-issues-with-code"></a></h2>
<p>A key feature of Github (as opposed to Git itself) is the issue
tracker. This provides us with a place to keep track of any problems or
bugs in the code and to discuss them with other developers. Sometimes
advanced users will also use issue trackers of public projects to report
problems they are having (and sometimes this is misused by users seeking
help using documented features of the program).</p>
<p>The code from the testing chapter earlier has a bug with an extra
bracket in eva_data_analysis.py (and if you’ve fixed that a missing
import of summarise_categorical in the test). Let’s go ahead and create
a new issue in our Github repository to describe this problem. We can
find the issue tracker on the “Issues” tab in the top left of the Github
page for the repository. Click on this and then click on the green “New
Issue” button on the right hand side of the screen. We can then enter a
title and description of our issue.</p>
<p>A good issue description should include:</p>
<ul><li>What the problem is, including any error messages that are
displayed.</li>
<li>What version of the software it occurred with.</li>
<li>Any relevant information about the system running it, for example
the operating system being used.</li>
<li>Versions of any dependent libraries.</li>
<li>How to reproduce it.</li>

number.</p>

<p>Branching is a feature of Git that allows two or more parallel
streams of work. Commits can be made to one branch without interfering
with another. Branches are commonly used as a way for one developer to
work on a new feature or a bug fix while other developers work on other
features. When those new features or bug fixes are complete, the branch
will be merged back with the main (sometimes called master) branch.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="creating-a-new-branch">Creating a new Branch<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-new-branch"></a></h3>
<p>New git branches are created with the <code>git branch</code>
command. This should be followed by the name of the branch to create. It
is common practice when the bug we are fixing has a corresponding issue
to name the branch after the issue number and name. For example, we
might call the branch <code>01-extra-brakcet-bug</code> instead of
something less descriptive like <code>bugfix</code>.</p>

<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode bash" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> branch 01-extra-brakcet-bug</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>will create a new branch called <code>01-extra-brakcet-bug</code>. We
can view the names of all the branches, by default there should be one
branch called <code>main</code> or perhaps <code>master</code> and our
new <code>01-extra-brakcet-bug</code> branch. by running
<code>git branch</code> with no parameters. This will put <code>*</code>
next to the currently active branch.</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb4">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode bash" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> branch</span></code></pre>
</div>
<div class="codewrapper">
<h3 class="code-label">OUTPUT<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="output" tabindex="0"><code>  01-extra-brakcet-bug
* main</code></pre>
</div>
<p>We can see that creating a new branch has not activated that branch.
To switch branches we can either use the <code>git switch</code> or
<code>git checkout</code> command followed by the branch name. For
example:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb6">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode bash" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> switch 01-extra-brakcet-bug</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>To create a branch and change to it in a single command we can use
<code>git switch</code> with the <code>-c</code> option (or
<code>git checkout</code> with the <code>-b</code> option,
<code>git switch</code> is only found in more recent versions of
Git).</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb7">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode bash" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> switch <span class="at">-c</span> 02-another-bug</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="committing-to-a-branch">Committing to a branch<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#committing-to-a-branch"></a></h3>
<p>Once we have switched to a branch any further commits that are made
will go to that branch. When we run a <code>git commit</code> command
we’ll see the name of the branch we’re committing to in the output of
<code>git commit</code>. Let’s edit our code and fix the lack of default
values bug that we entered into the issue tracker earlier on.</p>

<p>If we want to push our changes to a remote such as GitHub we have to

see the bugfix branch has appeared in the list of branches.</p>
<p>If we needed to pull changes from a branch on a remote (for example
if we’ve made changes on another computer or via Github’s web based

command.</p>

<h2 id="merging-branches">Merging Branches<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#merging-branches"></a></h2>
<p>When we have completed working on a branch (for example fixing a bug)
then we can merge our branch back into the main one (or any other
branch). This is done with the <code>git merge</code> command.</p>
<p>This must be run on the <em>TARGET</em> branch of the merge, so we’ll
have to use a <code>git switch</code> command to set this.</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb16">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<p>Now we’re back on the main branch we can go ahead and merge the
changes from the bugfix branch:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb17">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode bash" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> merge 01-extra-bracket-bug</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pull-requests"></a></h2>
<p>On larger projects we might need to have a code review process before
changes are merged, especially before they are merged onto the main
branch that might be what is being released as the public version of the
software. Github has a process for this that it calls a “Pull Request”,
other Git services such as GitLab have different names for this, GitLab
calls them “Merge Requests”. Pull requests are where one developer
requests that another merge code from a branch (or “pull” it from
another copy of the repository). The person receiving the request then
has the chance to review the code, write comments suggesting changes or
even change the code themselves before merging it. It is also very
common for automated checks of code to be run on a pull request to
ensure the code is of good quality and is passing automated tests.</p>
<p>As a simple example of a pull request, we can now create a pull
request for the changes we made on our <code>01-extra-bracket-bug</code>
branch and pushed to Github earlier on. The Github webpage for our
repository will now be saying something like “bugfix had recent pushes n
minutes ago - Compare &amp; Pull request”. Click on this button and
create a new pull request.</p>
<p>Give the pull request a title and write a brief description of it,
then click the green “Create pull request” button. Github will then
check if we can merge this pull request without any problems. We’ll look
at what to do when this isn’t possible later on.</p>
<p>There should be a green “Merge pull request” button, but if we click
on the down arrow inside this button there are three options on how to
handle this request:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Create a merge commit</li>
<li>Squash and merge</li>
<li>Rebase and merge</li>
</ol><p>The default is option 1, which will keep all of the commits made on
our branch intact. This can be useful for seeing the whole history of
our work, but if we’ve done a lot of minor edits or attempts at fixing a
problem to fix one bug it can be excessive to have all of this history
saved. This is where the second option comes in, this will place all of
our changes from the branch into just a single commit, this might be
much more obvious to other developers who will now see our bugfix as a
single commit in the history. The third option merges the branch
histories together in a different way that doesn’t make merges as
obvious, this can make the history easier to read but effectively
rewrites the commit history and will change the commit hash IDs. Some
projects that you contribute to might have their own rules about what
kind of merge they will prefer. For the purposes of this exercise we’ll
stick with the default merge commit.</p>
<p>Go ahead and click on “Merge pull request”, then “Confirm merge”. The
changes will now be merged together. Github gives us the option to
delete the branch we were working on, since it’s history is preserved in
the main branch there isn’t any reason to keep it.</p>

<h3 id="using-forks-instead-of-branches">Using Forks Instead of Branches<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-forks-instead-of-branches"></a></h3>
<p>A fork is similar to a branch, but instead of it being part of the
same repository it is a entirely new copy of the repository. Forks are
commonly used by Github users who wish to work on a project that they’re
not a member of. Typically forking will copy the repository to our own
namespace (e.g. github.com/username/reponame instead of
github.com/projectname/reponame)</p>
<p>To create a fork on github use the “Fork” button to the right of the
repository name. After we create our fork we can make some changes and
these could even be on the main branch inside our forked repository.
Github will track that a fork has been made displays a “Contribute”
button to create a pull request back to the original repository. Using
this we can request that the changes on our fork are incorporated by the
upstream project.</p>

<p>Q: Work in pairs for this exercise. Share the Github link of your
repository with your partner. If you have set your repository to
private, you’ll need to add them as a collaborator. Go to the settings
page on your Github repository’s webpage, click on Collaborators from
the left hand menu and then click the green “Add People” button and
enter the Github username or email address of your partner. They will
get an email and an alert within Github to accept your invitation to
work on this repository, without doing this they won’t be able to access
it.</p>
<ul><li>Now make a fork of your partners repository.</li>
<li>Edit the CITATION.cff file and add your name to it.</li>
<li>Commit these changes to your fork</li>
