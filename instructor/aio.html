<p>Before we start with the course, below we cover the terminology and
explain terms, phrases, and concepts associated with software
development in reproducible research that we will use in this
course.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Reproducibility</strong> - the ability to be reproduced or
copied; the extent to which consistent results are obtained when an
experiment is repeated (definition from <a href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" class="external-link">Google’s English
dictionary is provided by Oxford Languages</a>)</li>
<li>
<strong>Computational reproducibility</strong> - obtaining
consistent results using the same input data, computational methods
(code), and conditions of analysis; work that can be independently
recreated from the same data and the same code (<a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions" class="external-link">definition</a>
by the <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reproducible-research" class="external-link">Turing
Way’s “Guide to Reproducible Research”</a>)</li>
<li>
<strong>Reproducible research</strong> - the idea that scientific
results should be documented in such a way that their deduction is fully
transparent (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility" class="external-link">definition</a> from
Wikipedia)</li>
<li>
<strong>Open research</strong> - research that is openly accessible
by others; concerned with making research more transparent, more
collaborative, more wide-reaching, and more efficient (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research" class="external-link">definition</a> from
Wikipedia)</li>
<li>
<strong>FAIR</strong> - an acronym that stands for Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable</li>
<li>
<strong>Sustainable software development</strong> - software
development practice that takes into account longevity and
maintainability of code (e.g. beyond the lifetime of the project),
environmental impact, societal responsibility and ethics in our software
practices.</li>

<p>Think about the questions below. Your trainers may ask you to share
your answers in a shared notes document and/or discuss them with other
participants.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you understand by the words “open” and “reproducible” in the
context of research?</li>
<li>How many people or groups can you list that might benefit from your
work being open and reproducible?</li>
<li>How many times did you wish that someone else’s work you came across
was more open or accessible to you? Can you provide some examples?</li>

towards generalisability (the ultimate goal of research).</p>
<p>We can also further differentiate between:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Computational reproducibility</strong>: when detailed
information is provided about code, software, hardware and
implementation details.</li>
<li>
<strong>Empirical reproducibility</strong>: when detailed
information is provided about non-computational empirical scientific
experiments and observations. In practice, this is enabled by making the
data and details of how it was collected freely available.</li>
<li>
<strong>Statistical reproducibility</strong>: when detailed
information is provided, for example, about the choice of statistical
tests, model parameters, and threshold values. This mostly relates to
pre-registration of study design to prevent p-value hacking and other
manipulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, we are concerned with computational reproducibility,
i.e. when the application of computer science and software engineering
is used to aid solving research problems.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Scientific transparency and rigor are key factors in research.
Scientific methodology and results need to be published openly and
replicated and confirmed by several independent parties. However,
research papers often lack the full details required for independent
replication. Many attempts at replicating the results of well-known
scientific studies have failed in a variety of disciplines [reference].
This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis" class="external-link"><strong>the
reproducibility crisis</strong></a> - an ongoing methodological crisis
in which the results of many scientific studies are difficult or
impossible to reproduce.</p>
<p>Reproducible research is a practice that ensures that researchers can
repeat the same analysis multiple times with the same results. It offers
many benefits to those who practice it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reproducible research helps researchers remember how and why they
performed specific tasks and analyses; this enables easier explanation
of work to collaborators and reviewers.</li>
<li>Reproducible research enables researchers to quickly modify analyses
and figures - this is often required at all stages of research and
automating this process saves loads of time.</li>
<li>Reproducible research enables reusability of previously conducted
tasks so that new projects that require the same or similar tasks become
much easier and efficient by reusing or reconfiguring previous
work.</li>
<li>Reproducible research has greater impact on professional lives of
researchers through the ability to reuse and cite all research outputs -
including code and data.</li>
<li>Reproducible research is a strong indicator of rigor,
trustworthiness, and transparency in scientific research. This can
increase the quality and speed of peer review, because reviewers can
directly access the analytical process described in a manuscript. It
increases the probability that errors are caught early on - by
collaborators or during the peer-review process, helping alleviate the
reproducibility crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, reproducible research often requires that researchers
implement new practices and learn new tools. This course aims to teach
some of these practices and tools pertaining to the use of software to
conduct reproducible research.</p>

<p>Software is <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/quick-and-dirty-analysis-software-being-used-research-python-matlab-and-r" class="external-link">fundamental
to modern research</a> - some of it would even be impossible without
software. From short, thrown-together temporary scripts to solve a
specific problem and help with day-to-day research tasks, through an
abundance of complex spreadsheets analysing collected data, to the
hundreds of software engineers and millions of lines of code behind
international efforts such as the Large Hadron Collider and the Square
Kilometre Array, there are few areas of research where software does not
have a fundamental role.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that not all software that is used
in research is research software. We define “research software” as
software or code that is used to generate, process or analyse results of
a research for publication. For example, software used to guide a
telescope is not considered “research software”. On the other hand,
formulas or macros in spreadsheets used to analyse data are considered
“research code” - they are a form of computer programming in that allow
one to create, calculate, and change data sets in a number of different
ways.</p>

</figure><p>In the <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/quick-and-dirty-analysis-software-being-used-research-python-matlab-and-r" class="external-link">software
survey conducted by the Software Sustainability Institute in 2014</a>,
92% of researchers indicated they used some kind of software to aid or
conduct their research. Regardless of the type of the software used,
software is not reserved for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science" class="external-link">computational
science</a> (aka scientific computing) and “traditional” uses of
computing capabilities and infrastructures (e.g. simulations and
computational methods) any more. Nor is its restricted to “hard”
sciences - the <strong>use of research software is ubiquitous and fairly
even across all disciplines</strong>.</p>
<p>Research software is increasingly being developed - researchers do
not just use “off the shelf” software and the majority of researchers
develop their own. In order to be able to produce quality software that
outputs correct and verifiable results and that can be reused over time
- researchers require training. This course teaches good practises and
reproducible working methods that are agnostic of a programming language
(although we will use Python code as examples) and aims to provide
researchers with the tools and knowledge to feel confident when writing
good quality and sustainable software to support their research.
Typically, we think of such software as being <strong>FAIR</strong>.</p>
<p>In the rest of the course, we will explore what exactly we mean by
“FAIR research software”, why it is important and what practices can
help us along our “FAIRification” journey.</p>

<p>FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable and
comprises a set of principles designed to increase the visibility and
usefulness of your research to others. The FAIR data principles, first
published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618" class="external-link">in
2016</a>, are widely known and applied today. Similar <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x" class="external-link">FAIR
principles for software</a> have now been defined too. In general, they
mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Findable</strong> - software and its associated metadata
must be easy to discover by humans and machines.</li>
<li>
<strong>Accessible</strong> - in order to reuse software, the
software and its metadata must be retrievable by standard
protocols.</li>
<li>
<strong>Interoperable</strong> - when interacting with other
software it must be done by exchanging data and/or metadata through
standardised protocols and application programming interfaces
(APIs).</li>
<li>
<strong>Reusable</strong> - software should be usable (can be
executed) and reusable (can be understood, modified, built upon, or
incorporated into other software).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the above principles can be achieved by a number of practices
listed below. This is not exact science, and by all means the list below
is not exhaustive, but any of the practices that you employ to your
research software methodology will bring you closer to the gold standard
of a fully reproducible research.</p>
<ul>
<li>Findable
<ul>
<li>Create a description of your software</li>
<li>Place your software in a public software repository (and ideally
register it in a <a href="https://github.com/NLeSC/awesome-research-software-registries" class="external-link">software
registry</a>)</li>
<li>Use a unique and persistent identifier (DOI) for your software
(e.g. by depositing your code on Zenodo), which is also useful for
citations - note that depositing your data/code on GitHub and similar
software repositories may not be enough as they may change their open
access model or disappear completely</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accessible
<ul>
<li>Make sure people can freely, legally and easily get a copy your
software</li>
<li>Use coding conventions and comments to make your code readable and
understandable by people (once they get a copy of it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interoperable
<ul>
<li>Explain the functionality of your software</li>
<li>Use standard formats for inputs and outputs</li>
<li>Communicate with other software via standard protocols and APIs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reusable
<ul>
<li>Document your software (including its functionality, and how to
install and run it)</li>
<li>Follow best practices for software development (including coding
conventions, code readability and verifying its correctness)</li>
<li>Test your software and make sure it works on different
platforms/operating systems</li>
<li>Give a licence to your software clearly stating how it can be
reused</li>
<li>State how to cite your software</li>

<p>We are going to follow a fairly typical experience of a new PhD or
postdoc joining a research group. They were emailed some data and
analysis code bundled in a <code>.zip</code> archive and written by
another group member who works on similar things. They need to be able
to install and run this code on their machine, check they understand it
and then adapt it to their own project.</p>

Let’s unzip this archive and inspect its content in VS Code. The
software project contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>a JSON file (<code>data.json</code>) - a snippet of which is shown
below - with data on extra-vehicular activities (EVAs or spacewalks)
undertaken by astronauts and cosmonauts from 1965 to 2013 (data provided
by NASA via its <a href="https://data.nasa.gov/Raw-Data/Extra-vehicular-Activity-EVA-US-and-Russia/9kcy-zwvn/about_data" class="external-link">Open

<li>a Python script (<code>my code v2.py</code>) containing some
analysis.</li>

<h3 id="development-environment">Development environment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#development-environment"></a>
</h3>
<p>One of the first choices we make when writing code is what tool to
use to do the writing. You can use a simple text editor such as Notepad,
a terminal based editor with syntax highlighting such as Vim or Emacs,
or one of many Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) which give you
the tools to write, run and debug your code and inspect the output all
in one place. Note that you should not use word processing software such
as Microsoft Word or Apple Pages to write code - these tools are
designed to create nicely formatted text for humans to read, so they may
add or change formatting, or insert invisible characters that the
programming language cannot interpret. Try opening a Word document in
Notepad to see an example.</p>
<p>This is mostly a personal choice as an experienced user of any of
these tools can write good, FAIR software efficiently, but IDEs are
popular because they are designed specifically for writing and running
code. There are some language specific IDEs such as PyCharm, and some
that can work with many languages like VS Code (Visual Studio Code).
IDEs also have add-ons that provide extra functionality, such as
checking you are code as you type (similar to a spell-checker in Word),
highlighting when you are not following best practice, or even
automatically generating bits of code for you.</p>

<p>At this point you could open the Python file or another file in VS
Code to show all the squiggly lines suggesting improvements.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this course we will use VS Code IDE, as it is free, available on
Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems, and can be used with many
programming languages. It is a single tool in which we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>view our file system</li>
<li>open many kinds of files</li>
<li>edit, compile, run and debug code</li>
<li>open a terminal to run command line tools (including version control
tool Git) or view code outputs</li>
</ul>
<p>Use VS Code to open the Python script and the data file from our
project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="command-line-toolshell">Command line tool/shell<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#command-line-toolshell"></a>
</h3>
<p>In VS Code and similar IDEs you can often run the code by clicking a
button or pressing some keyboard shortcut. If you gave your code to a
colleague or collaborator they might use the same IDE or something
different, so you cannot guarantee that they will have the same buttons
and shortcuts as you.</p>
<p>In the previous episode we mentioned that interoperable software
should use standard protocols so that it can integrate with other tools.
One of these standard protocols/tools is the command line tool or shell.
This is one of the oldest ways of interacting with computers so many
programs will have command line interfaces. Command line tools, such as
Bash and Zsh, have their own language syntax that allow you to write
scripts and/or group and chain commands together to build up complex
workflows using several programs in different steps. They also use less
resources than a graphical user interface tool like an IDE, so are
commonly used on high-performance computers and other shared systems
where time, memory and processing power are expensive or in high
demand.</p>
<p>In this course we will use the Bash shell, which is one of the most
common and comes already installed on Mac and Linux operating systems.
You can create a command line interface to your program which will allow
it to be run on any system that has a Bash shell, and allow users to
change things like input and output files or choose different settings
or parameters without editing your code. With a command line interface,
your code can be built into automated workflows so that the whole
process from data gathering to analysis to saving publication-quality
results can be written in one Bash script and saved and reused.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="version-control">Version control<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#version-control"></a>
</h3>
<p>Version control means knowing what changes were made to your code and
when. Many people who have worked on large documents such as essays
start doing this by saving files called <code>essay_draft</code>,
<code>essay_version1.doc</code>, <code>essay_version2.doc</code>, and so
on. This can work on a small scale but most people find it quickly gets
confusing which version a certain change was made, or which version is
the one that you got feedback from a supervisor on. Using a version
control system helps you keep track of changes, including when you might
be working on shared code being edited by more than one person at a
time.</p>
<p>It also lets you assign version numbers or tags to particular
versions so you can then use those to refer back to them later. For
example you can run your code and output some results and add a comment
to your output that those results were produced by version 2.4 of your
code, so if you try to run the same thing later and find it is
different, you can check if it is a change in the code due to using a
newer version, or a change in the data, or something else.</p>
<p>We will be using the Git version control system, which can be used
through the command line, in a browser or in a desktop application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="testing">Testing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#testing"></a>
</h3>
<p>Testing ensures that your code is correct and does what it is set out
to do. When you write code you often feel very confident that it is
perfect, but when writing bigger codes or code that is meant to do
complex operations it is very hard to consider all possible edge cases
or notice every single typing mistake. Testing also gives other people
confidence in your code as they can see an example of how it is meant to
run and be assured that it does work correctly on their machine.</p>
<p>We will show different ways to test your code for different purposes.
You need to think about what it is that is important to you and any
future users or collaborators to decide what kind of testing is most
useful for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#documentation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Documentation comes in many forms - from the names of variables and
functions in your code, additional comments that explain some lines, up
to a whole website full of documentation in function definitions and
usage, tutorials and guides. You many not need as much documentation as
a large commercial software product, but making your code Reusable
relies on other people being able to understand what your code does and
how to use it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="licences-and-citation">Licences and citation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#licences-and-citation"></a>
</h3>
<p>A licence states what people can legally do with your code, and what
restrictions you have placed on it. Whenever you want to use someone
else’s code you should check what license they have and make sure your
use is legal. You may be restricted by your institution, your grant
funding, or by other tools you use that require certain licenses for you
to be compatible with them.</p>
<p>Having a citation guidance is not a legal requirement but if you want
to get academic credit for your work you can make other people’s life
much easier by telling them how you would like to be credited, and
making sure when you use ohers code in your research that you give them
credit as they want.</p>
<p>Both licensing law and citation proceedures can vary depending on
your country and institution, so remember to check with a local team
where you are. Your local research IT or library team would be a good
place to start.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="code-repositories-and-registries">Code repositories and registries<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-repositories-and-registries"></a>
</h3>
<p>Having somewhere to share your code is fundamental to making it
Findable. Your institution might have a code repository, your research
field may have a practice of sharing code in a specific website or
journal, or your version control system might include an online
component that makes sharing different versions of your code easy.
Again, remember to check the rules of your institution and grant on
publising code, and any licenses for code you depend on or reuse.</p>
<p>We will discuss later how to share your code on GitHub and make it
easy for others to find and use.</p>

<p>In this episode, we will begin to cover the basics of version control
and explore how this tool assists us in producing reproducible and
sustainable scientific projects. We will create a new software project
from our existing code, make some changes to it and track them with
version control, and then push those changes to a remote server for
safe-keeping.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-is-a-version-control-system">What is a version control system?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-a-version-control-system"></a>
</h3>
<p>Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to
files. Version control systems are software tools that assist in the
management of these file changes over time. They keep track of every
modification to the files in a special database that allows users to
“travel through time” and compare earlier versions of the files with the
current state.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="motivation-for-using-a-version-control-system">Motivation for using a version control system<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#motivation-for-using-a-version-control-system"></a>
</h3>
<p>The main motivation as scientists to use version control in our
projects is for reproducibility purposes. As hinted to above, by
tracking and storing every change we make, we can more effectively
restore the state of the project at any point in time. This is
incredibly useful if we want to reproduce results from a specific
version of the code, or track down changes that broke some
functionality.</p>
<p>The other benefit we gain is that version control provides us with
provenance of the project. As we make each change, we also leave a
message about what the change was and why it was made. This improves the
transparency of the project and makes it auditable, which is good
scientific practice.</p>
<p>Later on in this workshop, we will also see how using a version
control system allows many people to collaborate on the same project
without a lot of manual effortto combine different items of work.</p>

about the changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should
complete the sentence “If applied, this commit will”. If you want to go

<p>Did you notice how when we were typing the Python script into the
terminal, we had to add a slash before the space like this:
<code>my\ code\ v2.py</code>? Using a backslash in this way is called
‘escaping’ and it lets the terminal know to treat the space as part of
the filename, and not a separate argument. However, it is pretty
annoying and considered bad practice to have spaces in your filenames
like this, especially if you’ll be manipulating them from the terminal.
So let’s go ahead and remove the space from the filename altogether and
replace it with a hyphen instead. You can use the <code>mv</code>
command again like so:</p>

<h3 id="commit-messages">Commit messages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#commit-messages"></a>
</h3>
<p>We have already met the concept of commit messages when we made and
stored changes to our code files. Commit messages are short descriptions
of, and the motivation for, what a commit will achieve. It’s therefore
important to take some time to ensure these commit messages are helpful
and descriptive, as when work is reviewed (by your future self or a
collaborator) they provide the context of what change was made and why.
This can make tracking down specific changes in commits much easier,
without having to inspect the code or files themselves.</p>
<p>Generally, commit messages should complete the sentence “If applied,
this commit will…”. Most often a short, 50 character (ish) title will
suffice, but a longer-form description of the changes can also be
provided by leaving a blank space between the summary line and the rest
of the message. There are many different conventions that can be used
for commit messages that range from very structured (such as <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/" class="external-link">conventional
commits</a>) to the fun (such as <a href="https://gitmoji.dev/" class="external-link">gitmoji</a>). The important thing is that it
is clear to the reader what a commit is doing and why. If a project is
using a specific commit message convention, this will often be described
in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributing_guidelines" class="external-link">contributing
guidelines</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>If we want our commit messages to be descriptive and help us
understand the changes in the project over time, then we also have to
make commits that are very self-contained. That is to say that each
commit we make should only change one, logical thing. By “logical” here,
we mean that one aspect of updating the files has been achieved to
completion - such as adding docstrings or refactoring a function - we
don’t mean that changes are committed line-by-line. See the <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Things_to_avoid_when_creating_commits" class="external-link">“Things
to avoid when creating commits” section</a> of <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages" class="external-link">Openstack’s
“Git Commit Good Practice” documentation</a> for examples of logical,
self-contained commits, and commits that don’t follow this practice.</p>
<p>The reasons that self-contained commits are important are that: it
helps with reviewing changes if each commit tackles one step; if code
breaks, tracking down the specific change that caused the break is
simpler; if you need to undo changes, you can remove them in small
increments, rather than losing a lot of unrelated work along with the
change you do want to remove.</p>

<p>This output demonstrates why it is important to write meaningful and
descriptive commit messages. Without the messages, we will only have the
commit hashes (the strings of random numbers and letters after “commit”)
to identify each commit, which would be impossible for us.</p>
<p>We may need to inspect our recent commits to establish where a bug
was introduced or because we’ve decided that our recent work isn’t
suitable and we wish to discard it and start again. Once we have
identified the last commit we want to keep, we can revert the state of
our project back to that commit with a few different methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert" class="external-link"><code>git revert</code></a>:
This command reverts a commit by creating a new commit that reverses the
action of the supplied commit or list of commits. Because this comand
creates new commits, your git history is more complete and tells the
story of exactly what work you did, i.e., deciding to discard some
work.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset" class="external-link"><code>git reset</code></a>:
This command will recover the state of the project at the specified
commit. What is done with the commits you had made is defined by some
optional flags:
<ul>
<li>
<code>--soft</code>: Any changes you had made would be preserved and
left as “Changes to be committed”</li>
<li>
<code>--mixed</code>: Any changes you had made would be preserved
but not marked for commit (this is the default action)</li>
<li>
<code>--hard</code>: All changes you had made are discarded Using
this command produces a “cleaner” history, but does not tell the full
story and your work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the benefits of using a distributed version control system,
such as Git, is its distributed nature. So far we have have been working
with a project on our local machines and, even though we have been
incrementally saving our work in a way that is recoverable (version
control), if anything happened to our laptops, the whole project would
be lost. However, we can use the distribution aspect of Git to push our
projects and histories to a server (someone else’s computer) so that
they are accessible and retrievable if the worst were to happen to our
machines. Distributing our projects in this way also opens us up to
collaboration since colleagues would be able to access our projects,
make their own copies on their machines, and conduct their own work.</p>
<p>We will now go through how to push a local project to <a href="https://github.com" class="external-link">GitHub</a>, though other Git hosting services
are available, such as <a href="https://gitlab.com" class="external-link">GitLab</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org" class="external-link">Bitbucket</a>.</p>

servers. GitHub provides some instructions on how to do that for
different scenarios. You want to use the instructions under the heading
“…or push an existing repository from the command line”. These
instructions will look like this:</p>

<p>Let’s explain a bit more about what those commands did…</p>

</div>
<p>This command tells Git to create a <code>remote</code> called
“origin” and link it to the URL of your GitHub repository. A
<code>remote</code> is a version control concept where two (or more)
repositories are connected to each other in such a way that they can be
kept in sync by exchanging commits. “origin” is a name used to refer to
the remote repository. It could be called anything, but “origin” is a
convention that is often used by default in Git and GitHub since it
indicates which repository is considered the “source of truth”,
particularly useful when many people are collaborating on the same
repository.</p>

</div>
<p><code>git branch</code> is a command used to manage branches. We’ll
discuss branches later on in the workshop. This command ensures the
branch we are working on is called “main”. This will be the default
branch of the project for everyone working on it.</p>

</div>
<p>The <code>git push</code> command is used to update remote references
with any changes you have made locally. This command tells Git to update
the “main” branch on the “origin” remote. The <code>-u</code> flag
(short for <code>--set-upstream</code>) will set a tracking reference,
so that in the future only <code>git push</code> can be run without the
need to specify the remote and reference name.</p>

</h3>
<p>During this episode, we have covered the basics of using version
control to track changes to our projects. We have seen how to: create
new projects, incrementally save progress, construct informative commit
messages and content, inspect the history of our projects and retrieve
the state, and push our projects to distributed servers.</p>
<p>These skills are critical to reproducible and sustainable science
since using version control makes our work self-documenting - the commit
messages provide the narrative of what changed and why - and we can
recover the exact state of our projects at a specific time, so we can
more reliably run the “same” code again. We can also back up our
projects by pushing them to distributed, remote servers and reduce the
risk of data loss over the course of a project’s lifetime.</p>
<p>Version control is a vast topic and we have only covered the absolute
basics here as a brief introduction. For a deeper and more complete dive
into the subject matter, please see the “Further reading” section

<h3 id="motivation-for-code-readability">Motivation for code readability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#motivation-for-code-readability"></a>
</h3>
<p>When someone writes code, they do so based on requirements that are
likely to change in the future. Requirements change because software
interacts with the real world, which is dynamic. When these requirements
change, the developer (who is not necessarily the same person who wrote
the original code) must implement the new requirements. They do this by
reading the original code to understand the different abstractions, and
identify what needs to change. Readable code facilitates the reading and
understanding of the abstraction phases and, as a result, facilitates
the evolution of the codebase. Readable code saves future developers’
time and effort.</p>
<p>In order to develop readable code, we should ask ourselves: “If I
re-read this piece of code in fifteen days or one year, will I be able
to understand what I have done and why?” Or even better: “If a new
person who just joined the project reads my software, will they be able
to understand what I have written here?”</p>
<p>We will now learn about a few software best practices we can follow
to help create readable code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="variable-names">Variable names<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#variable-names"></a>
</h3>
<p>Variables are the most common thing you will assign when coding, and
it’s really important that it is clear what each variable means in order
to understand what the code is doing. If you return to your code after a
long time doing something else, or share your code with a colleague, it
should be easy enough to understand what variables are involved in your
code from their names. Therefore we need to give them clear names, but
we also want to keep them concise so the code stays readable. There are
no “hard and fast rules” here, and it’s often a case where you will need
to use your best judgment.</p>
<p>Some useful tips for naming variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short words are better than single character names
<ul>
<li>For example, if we were creating a variable to store the speed to
read a file, <code>s</code> (for ‘speed’) is not descriptive enough but
<code>MBReadPerSecondAverageAfterLastFlushToLog</code> is too long to
read and prone to mispellings. <code>ReadSpeed</code> (or
<code>read_speed</code>) would suffice.</li>
<li>If you’re finding it difficult to come up with a variable name that
is <em>both</em> short and descriptive, go with the short version and
use an inline comment to desribe it further (more on those in the next
section!)</li>
<li>This guidance doesn’t necessarily apply if your variable is a
well-known constant in your domain, for example, <em>c</em> represents
the speed of light in Physics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Try to be descriptive where possible, and avoid names like
<code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, <code>var</code>,
<code>thing</code>, and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some gotchas to consider when naming variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be some restrictions on which characters you can use in
your variable names. For instance in Python, only alphanumeric
characters and underscores are permitted.</li>
<li>Particularly in Python, you cannot <em>begin</em> your variable
names with numerical characters as this will raise a syntax error.
<ul>
<li>Numerical characters can be included in a variable name, just not as
the first character. For example, <code>thing1</code> is a valid
variable name, but <code>1thing</code> isn’t. (This behaviour may be
different for other programming languages.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In some programming languages, such as Python, variable names are
case sensitive. So <code>speed_of_light</code> and
<code>Speed_Of_Light</code> will <strong>not</strong> be
equivalent.</li>
<li>Programming languages often have global pre-built functions, such as
<code>input</code>, which you may accidentally overwrite if you assign a
variable with the same name.
<ul>
<li>Again in Python, you would actually reassign the <code>input</code>
name and no longer be able to access the original <code>input</code>
function if you used this as a variable name. So in this case opting for
something like <code>input_data</code> would be preferable. (This
behaviour may be explicitly disallowed in other programming
languages.)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Commenting is a very useful practice to help convey the context of
the code. It can be helpful as a reminder for your future self or your
collaborators as to why code is written in a certain way, how it is
achieving a specific task, or the real-world implications of your
code.</p>
<p>There are many ways to add comments to code, the most common of which
is inline comments.</p>

</div>
<p>Again, there are few hard and fast rules to using comments, just
apply your best judgment. But here are a few things to keep in mind when
commenting your code:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Avoid using comments to explain <em>what</em> your code
does.</strong> If your code is too complex for other programmers to
understand, consider rewriting it for clarity rather than adding
comments to explain it.</li>
<li>Focus on the <strong><em>why</em></strong> and the
<strong><em>how</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Make sure you’re not reiterating something that your code already
conveys on its own. Comments shouldn’t echo your code.</li>
<li>Keep them short and concise. Large blocks of text quickly become
unreadable and difficult to maintain.</li>
<li>Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments. Always
make a priority of keeping comments up-to-date when code changes.</li>

</h3>
<p>Functions are a fundamental concept in writing software and are one
of the core ways you can organise your code to improve its readability.
A function is an isolated section of code that performs a single,
<em>specific</em> task that can be simple or complex. It can then be
called multiple times with different inputs throughout a codebase, but
it’s definition only needs to appear once.</p>
<p>Breaking up code into functions in this manner benefits readability
since the smaller sections are easier to read and understand. Since
functions can be reused, codebases naturally begin to follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" class="external-link">Don’t
Repeat Yourself principle</a> which prevents software from becoming
overly long and confusing. The software also becomes easier to maintain
because, if the code encapsulated in a function needs to change, it only
needs updating in one place instead of many. As we will learn in a
future episode, testing code also becomes simpler when code is written
in functions. Each function can be individually checked to ensure it is
doing what is intended, which improves confidence in the software as a
whole.</p>

structure using the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" class="external-link"><code>pandas</code> library</a> - but
the code is out of order! Reorder the lines of code within the function
so that the JSON file is read in using the <code>read_json</code>
method, any incomplete rows are <em>dropped</em>, the values are
<em>sorted</em> by date, and then the cleaned dataframe is
<em>returned</em>. There is also a <code>print</code> statement that
will display which file is being read in on the command line for
verification.</p>

<p>We have chosen to create a function for reading in data files since
this is a very common task within research software. While this isn’t
that many lines of code, thanks to using pandas inbuilt methods, it can
be useful to package this together into a function if you need to read
in a lot of similarly structured files and process them in the same
way.</p>

<h3 id="docstrings">Docstrings<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#docstrings"></a>
</h3>
<p>Docstrings are a specific type of documentation that are provided
within functions, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" class="external-link">classes</a> too.
A function docstring should explain what the isolated code is doing,
what parameters the function needs (these are inputs) and what form they
should take, what the function outputs (you may see words like ‘returns’
or ‘yields’ here), and errors (if any) that might be raised.</p>
<p>Providing these docstrings helps improve code readability since it
makes the function code more transparent and aids understanding.
Particularly, docstrings that provide information on the input and
output of functions makes it easier to reuse them in other parts of the
code, without having to read the full function to understand what needs
to be provided and what will be returned.</p>
<p>Docstrings are another case where there are no hard and fast rules
for writing them. Acceptable docstring formats can range from single- to
multi-line. You can use your best judgment on how much documentation a
particular function needs.</p>

<p>Some projects may have their own guidelines on how to write
docstrings, such as <a href="https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard" class="external-link">numpy</a>.
If you are contributing code to a wider project or community, try to
follow the guidelines and standards they provide for codestyle.</p>
<p>As your code grows and becomes more complex, the docstrings can form
the content of a reference guide allowing developers to quickly look up
how to use the APIs, functions, and classes defined in your codebase.
Hence, it is common to find tools that will automatically extract
docstrings from your code and generate a website where people can learn
about your code without downloading/installing and reading the code
files - such as <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/automatic-doc-generation.html" class="external-link">sphinx
for Python</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Formal testing of scientific code is important to demonstrate to
ourselves and to our readers that our code does what is supposed to
do.<br>
</li>
<li>An absence of tests makes our software risky for others to use and
as a result, may reduce its impact.</li>
<li>Unit tests are software tests intended to demonstrate that each
component of our code e.g. individual functions work as expected. Unit
tests typically contain assertions that specify how we expect our code
to behave under a given set of conditions.<br>
</li>
<li>A good unit test should focus on verifying a single aspect of a
function’s behaviour.<br>
</li>
<li>Unit testing has many benefits including: (i) it reduces the
probability that our code contains errors and (ii) it encourages us to
write readable, modular code.</li>
<li>Unit tests can be automated using a unit-testing framework such
e.g. Pytest for Python. Test automation allows us to add new
functionality or refactor parts of our code and easily check whether it
still works as expected after our changes.</li>
<li>Code coverage is a metric that tells us the percentage of lines of
code in our software that are run when our tests are executed. A code
coverage report can help us to identify parts of our code that may need
additional tests.</li>
<li>If we need to prioritise where we focus our testing efforts we
should focus on the parts of our code that are “highest risk” i.e. could
affect the correctness of our research findings.</li>

<h3 id="copyright-licenses">Copyright Licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#copyright-licenses"></a>
</h3>
<p>The authors of any creative work such as written text, photographs,
films, music and computer code are protected by Copyright law. This
allows them to set the terms under which their work can be copied or
reproduced. This often takes the form of the creator of the work selling
copies of it and receiving a fee from each person who obtains a copy.
Those receiving the copies are typically forbidden from making
additional copies without the permission of the creator. For example if
an author writes a book they will receive some money for each copy of
that book that’s sold and anybody who makes and sells a copy of that
book would need their permission to do so.</p>
<p>Copyright licenses don’t necessarily require any money to be charged
for copies and the creator might choose to let anybody copy their work,
providing they don’t change it and keep their name on it.</p>
<p>Copyright is automatically implied, any creative work which doesn’t
specify a license should be assumed to be copyrighted. If it were ever
to come to a court case then the author might have a problem proving
this and enforcing their copyright. Technically the work is copyrighted
the moment it is created, even without any kind of copyright statement,
registration or license agreement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="copyright-and-open-source">Copyright and Open Source<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#copyright-and-open-source"></a>
</h3>
<p>An Open Source license is a form of copyright license that gives
anybody who receives a copy of a work the right to make additional
copies and distribute them to anybody else. It also allows anybody who
receives a copy to make changes to the original work and to redistribute
those. When applied to software this usually requires that anybody
supplying the executable binary of a program must also supply the source
code if requested.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="copyright-statements">Copyright Statements<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#copyright-statements"></a>
</h3>
<p>A common way to declare your copyright of a program and the license
you are distributing it under is to include a file called LICENSE in
your code repository, to display it in comments in a code file or to
display it on screen when the program is run. At the very least each
source file should state what license the code is under and tell the
reader to refer to the LICENSE file. This means that if the code ever
gets (accidentally) redistributed without the license file then the
reader will still know about the license that was used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="free-software">Free Software<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#free-software"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the early history of computing there were often informal
agreements where programmers would share source code with each other,
but this was rarely backed up with any formal copyright license. As the
field grew this was first formalised in the 1980s by Richard Stallman
who formed the Free Software Foundation and defined “Free Software” as
software which which respects users freedoms by granting them four
freedoms:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does
your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition
for this.</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your
neighbor.</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition
for this.</li>
</ol>
<p>The term “Free” in English often causes some confusion here as it can
mean both “free as in freedom” and “free as in beer” (no charge). The
term “Libre” software is sometimes used instead of “Free” to help
clarify this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="open-source-definition">Open Source Definition<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#open-source-definition"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the 1990s the “Open Source” movement wanted to make a more
business friendly term and thought using the term “Free” might lead to
confusion when people wanted to charge for software. Despite “Free
Software” often being given away for no charge (or just a small
charge/suggested donation to cover media or distribution costs), nothing
in the four freedoms and the software licenses that were designed around
it prohibits charging for software.</p>
<p>In 1998 the Open Source Definition was created and says that software
which is open source must be distributed under the a license which
allows the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Free Redistribution must be allowed</li>
<li>Source Code must be included</li>
<li>Derived Works must be allowed</li>
<li>Integrity of The Author’s Source Code - There can only be
restrictions on the distribution of modifications if patches can be
distributed instead. Must explicitly permit distribution of software
built from modified source code. The license may require derived works
to carry a different name or version number from the original
software.</li>
<li>No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</li>
<li>No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</li>
<li>Distribution of License - License applies to anyone the software is
distributed to</li>
<li>License Must Not Be Specific to a Product - the program can be
extracted from other software it is distributed with</li>
<li>License Must Not Restrict Other Software, e.g. can’t insist it is
only distributed alongside other open source software.</li>
<li>License Must Be Technology-Neutral</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="free-and-open-source-software">Free and Open Source Software<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#free-and-open-source-software"></a>
</h3>
<p>Because of these two terms many people use the term “Free and Open
Source Software” (FOSS), while other’s simple say “Open Source Software”
and some will say “Free Software”. In reality these all have very
similar meanings that will respect the four freedoms and the open source
definition. For the rest of this chapter we will refer to “Open Source”,
but could have equally said “Free and Open Source Software” or “Free
Software”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="types-of-licenses">Types of licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-licenses"></a>
</h2>
<p>A number licenses have been written that conform to the Four Freedoms
and/or the Open Source definition. Each of these set out the rights of
anybody receiving software that is distributed under that license. We
will look at a few of the most popular ones.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="public-domain">Public Domain<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#public-domain"></a>
</h3>
<p>Before we look at any licenses in detail, one other thing to consider
is Public Domain. This is a concept in some countries (but not all)
where a work is not protected by copyright. These works have no license
from their creators and typically anybody can do anything they like with
them. Copyrights are usually time limited to between 50 and 100 years
and in many jurisdictions when Copyrights expire the works enter the
public domain. It is for this reason that the works of Charles Dickens
are no longer subject to Copyright and anybody can make a copy of them.
In some jurisdictions works can be placed straight into the public
domain simply with a declaration within the work. In the USA works
produced by the federal government are automatically public domain. But
in other countries works need to be registered as public domain. For
this reason it isn’t recommended to simply make work public domain if
you want to release it for use across the world.</p>
<p>If you really want to release code under something very similar to
public domain then the <a href="https://unlicense.org/" class="external-link">unlicense</a>
could be for you. It states that anybody is free to use the software in
any way they like. In jurisdictions with public domain, it “dedicates”
the software into the public domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="permissive-licenses">Permissive Licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#permissive-licenses"></a>
</h3>
<p>Some of the simplest open source licenses are known as the
“permissive licenses”. Broadly speaking these require anybody
redistributing the code to include the license text and a copyright
statement crediting the authors. But they do not require any
modifications to release their source code alongside the executable
program. This allows software released under these licenses to be made
into part of a closed source program and all the creator of the closed
source program needs to do is distribute the license text and perhaps
some crediting statement to the original author, but they don’t need to
redistribute the source code with their closed source program.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="mit-license">MIT License<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mit-license"></a>
</h4>
<p>The MIT License is very simple and a very popular choice of license,
it is only three paragraphs long. It states that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anybody receiving the software can copy, modify, merge, publish,
distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software to anybody
they like.</li>
<li>That they must include the license text and copyright statement when
they redistribute it.</li>
<li>That there’s no warranty included and you can’t hold the authors
liable for any problems or damages that might arise.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="bsd">BSD<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bsd"></a>
</h4>
<p>The BSD license is very similar to the MIT license, but it has
several variants. The oldest is the 4 clause version which requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source code redistributions must include the copyright statement and
license text.</li>
<li>Binary redistributions must include the copyright notice and license
text in their documentation.</li>
<li>Any advertising for the software incorporating this software must
include a statement saying that it includes software written by the
author.</li>
<li>That the author doesn’t endorse any derived products.</li>
<li>That the author doesn’t provide a warranty. (this is written in a
separate section and isn’t one of the 4 clauses)</li>
</ul>
<p>The acknowledgement/advertising clause caused some controversy and
some people thought that it didn’t meet the open source definition or
comply with the four freedoms. It also became impractical and lead to
very long statements where there were multiple authors of large pieces
of software.</p>
<p>To address this a new version of the license known as the 3 clause
BSD license was created. This removed the acknowledgement clause. An
even simpler 2 clause version removes the endorsement clause.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="apache-2-0">Apache 2.0<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#apache-2-0"></a>
</h4>
<p>Another popular permissive license is the Apache 2.0 license. It is
very similar to the MIT and BSD licenses, but also includes some clauses
about patent licensing. These require any contributor to a program which
is licensed under Apache 2.0 to allow their patents to be used free of
charge by any user of the software. This was done to head off some
concerns about software patent legislation at the time the license was
developed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="copyleft-licenses">Copyleft Licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#copyleft-licenses"></a>
</h3>
<p>The other common form of open source licenses are the “Copyleft”
licenses. These require that any modifications to the program are also
released under a compatible copyleft license. This can cause
complications when combining code that’s under copyleft with other
licenses as now the entire codebase must be released under the copyleft
license. If there are any incompatible terms in the other license then
this can prevent the two codebases from being combined.</p>
<p>The main advantage of copyleft licenses is that anybody else who
incorporates the code into another product must also keep that product
open and this makes it harder for it to be subsumed into a commercial
product that doesn’t contribute improvements to the code back to the
community which created it.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="gpl-version-2">GPL version 2<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#gpl-version-2"></a>
</h4>
<p>The mostly commonly known copyleft license is the GNU Public License
or GPL. There are several versions of the GPL available, the oldest GPL
version 1.0, but this version was quickly replaced with version 2.0 and
was rarely used. Version 2 is much more common and is used by a lot of
popular software including the Linux Kernel. Compared with the
permissive license the GPL is quite a long license agreement and many of
its clauses can be quite difficult for non-lawyers to fully
understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="gpl-version-3">GPL version 3<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#gpl-version-3"></a>
</h4>
<p>The GPL version 3 was introduced to try and prevent patenting of
software under the license and to require that people distributing GPL
code on embedded systems must also give users the ability to rebuild
that software and use it in their device. It is an even longer document
than GPL version 2 and has proved controversial with some and despite
coming out in 2007 hasn’t been adopted by many projects which used GPL
version 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="lgpl">LGPL<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lgpl"></a>
</h4>
<p>In order to allow library software to be combined with (“linked” in
technical terms) other software that’s no GPLed, a special version of
the GPL called the LGPL (L for “Lesser” or “Library”) was created. This
is used by many popular libraries including the GNU C library that is
linked to every C program compiled on a Linux system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="agpl">AGPL<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#agpl"></a>
</h4>
<p>One problem for the GPL is that a lot of modern software doesn’t run
on user’s own computers, but on remote web servers that they connect to
through their web browser. When a user run’s one of these web
applications they aren’t receiving a copy of the software’s executable
binaries, but are interacting with them over a computer network such as
the internet. This doesn’t meet the GPL’s definition of distributing the
binaries, so even if the web application is under the GPL, the person
running the server has no obligation to supply users with the source
code. The Affero GPL or AGPL requires that people running web
applications licensed under the AGPL make the source code available to
the users of those web applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="choosing-a-license">Choosing a License<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choosing-a-license"></a>
</h3>
<p>When choosing a license for your code there’s a number of things you
might want to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to ensure that anybody modifying and redistributing your
code will release the source code of their changes?</li>
<li>Or would you prefer to ensure the least number of restrictions and
that your code will be used as widely as possible? Even if that means it
might end up in commercial products that don’t release their source
code.</li>
<li>Are you reusing code which is already under an open source license?
What obligations do you have under those licenses?</li>
<li>Is there a preferred license in your research community?</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t be tempted to write you’re own license (or modify an existing
one) unless you are a copyright lawyer. The common open source licenses
have been carefully written by copyright lawyers, many of them have
undergone multiple iterations in response to cases that have arisen and
the implications of many different legal jurisidcitons has been
considered. The common licenses are also well known, meaning that
potential users and contributors have a better understanding of what
their rights and responsibilities are leaving less room for
misunderstanding.</p>

<h3 id="creative-commons-licenses">Creative Commons Licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creative-commons-licenses"></a>
</h3>
<p>All of the licenses we’ve discussed so far are really only intended
for source code. They are not suitable for documentation, datasets,
drawings, logos, music, maps etc. To solve this problem there are the
Creative Commons licenses, which are expressly built for anything other
than source code. Creative commons has now gone through four versions
with the latest being version 4.0, generally you should use version 4.0
as this is more suited for use around the world</p>
<p>There are several different types of Creative Commons licenses:</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="cc0">CC0<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cc0"></a>
</h4>
<p>Creative Commons Zero or CC0 is the simplest license and is
effectively a public domain license, but is suitable for use world
wide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="attribution-by">Attribution (BY)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#attribution-by"></a>
</h4>
<p>All the Creative Commons licenses apart from CC0 require you to give
credit to the original creator. This is very similar to what is required
by all of the permissive code licenses.</p>

<p>Generally you can relicense someone else’s code under more permissive
licenses to less permissive ones without their permission. For example
you could relicense code from the MIT license to the GPL. This is
because nothing in the GPL contradicts anything in the MIT license, but
you’ll still have to display the MIT license for the original code and
the GPL for your modifications.</p>
<p>This doesn’t work the other way though, you can’t take code released
under GPL and relicense it as MIT since MIT is a more liberal license
that doesn’t match the terms of the GPL.</p>
<p>Creative commons zero or public domain code can usually be relicensed
to any open source license (or a commercial license for that
matter).</p>
<p>Sometimes there are contradictory statements in licenses which
prevent relicensing. For example Apache 2 has some provisions about
software patents, you won’t be able to relicense Apache 2 code under MIT
since it doesn’t have an equivalent patent clause.</p>
<p>The GNU project has a <a href="useful%20guide">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html</a>
to license compatibility on their website.</p>

<h3 id="getting-agreement-to-relicense">Getting agreement to relicense<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#getting-agreement-to-relicense"></a>
</h3>
<p>Sometimes the developers of a program will wish to change the license
it is distributed under. In order to do this they’ll need the agreement
of all the copyright holders of the program and typically this will mean
everyone who contributed code to it. This is fine if you only have a
handful of contributors to your project, but gets harder when the
project starts to grow bigger.</p>
<p>Some projects work around this by having contributors agree to a
“contributor license agreement”. This will set out the terms under which
the code is contributed to the project. It might include a copyright
assignment or just granting certain rights to the project. This usually
allows the company (or non-profit foundation as many open source
projects are based on non-profit foundations) running the project to
relicense the code in future and to take legal action against people who
violate the license.</p>

Definition or the Four Freedoms the person receiving the software can
make copies and give (or sell) them to anybody else.</p>
<p>It is also possible to release software under a two licenses, one
open source and one commercial. This has been done by a few open source
projects who wish to sell the software to some customers (sometimes with
extra custom modifications) and give it to others.</p>

</h3>
<p>By default repositories created on Github are private and only their
creator can see them. If we’re going to be adding an open source license
to our repository we probably want to make sure people can actually
access it too!</p>
<p>Go to the Github webpage of your repository
(<code>https://github.com/&lt;yourusername&gt;/&lt;yourrepsoitoryname&gt;</code>)
and click on the Settings link near the top right corner. Then scroll
down to the bottom of the page and the “Danger Zone” settings. Click on
“Change Visibility” and you should see a message saying “Change to
public”, if it says “Change to private” then the repository is already
public. You’ll then be asked to confirm that you want to make the
repository public and agree to the warning that the code will now be
publicly visible. As a security measure you’ll then have to put in your
Github password.</p>

<p>Currently our repository is under the Github “namespace” of our
individual user. This is ok for individual projects where we are the
sole or at least main author, but for bigger and more complex projects
it is common to use a Github organisation named after our project. If we
are a member of an organisation and have the appropriate permissions
then we can transfer a repository from our personal namespace to the
organisation’s. This can be done with another option in the “Danger
Zone” settings, the “Transfer ownership” button. Pressing this will then
prompt us as to which organisation we want to transfer the repository
to.</p>

</h3>
<p>Zenodo is a data archive run by CERN. Anybody can upload datasets up
to 50GB to it and receive a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Zenodo’s
definition of a dataset is quite broad and can include code. This gives
us a way to obtain a DOI for our code. We can archive our Github
repository to Zenodo by doing the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to the <a href="https://zenodo.org/login" class="external-link">Zenodo Login page</a>
and choose to login with Github.</li>
<li>Authorise Zenodo to connect to Github.</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/" class="external-link">Github page</a> in
your Zenodo account. This can be found in the pull down menu with your
user name in the top right corner of the screen.</li>
<li>You’ll now have a list of all of your Github repositories. Next to
each will be an “On” button. If you have created a new repository you
might need to press the “Sync” button to update the list of repositories
Zenodo knows about.</li>
<li>Press the “On” button for the repository you want to archive. If
this was successful you’ll be told to refresh the page.</li>
<li>The repository should now appear in the list of Enabled repositories
at the top of the screen. But it doesn’t yet have a DOI. To get one we
have to make a release on Github. Click on the repository and then press
the green button to create a release. This will take you to Github’s
release page where you’ll be asked to give a title and description of
the release. You will also have to create a tag, this is a way of having
a friendly name for the version of some code in Git instead of using a
long hash code. Often we’ll create a sequential version number for each
release of the software and have the tag name match this, for example
v1.0 or just 1.0.</li>
<li>If we now refresh the Zenodo page for this repository we will see
that it has been assigned a DOI.</li>
</ol>
<p>The DOI doesn’t just link to Github, Zenodo will have taken a copy of
our repository at the point where we tagged the release. This means that
even if we delete it from Github or even if Github were ever to go away
or remove it, they’ll still be a copy on Zenodo. Zenodo will allow
people to download the entire repository as a single Zip file.</p>
<p>Zenodo will have actually created two DOIs for you. One represents
the latest version of the software and will always represent the latest
if you make more releases. The other is specfic to the release you made
and will always point to that version. We can see both of these by
clicking on the DOI link in the Zenodo page for the repository. One of
the things which is displayed on this page is a badge image that you can
copy the link for and add to the README file in your Git repository so
that people can find the Zenodo version of the repository. If you click
on the DOI image in the Details section of the Zenodo page then you will
be shown instructions for obtaining a link to the DOI badge in various
formats including Markdown. Here is the badge for this repository:</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11869450" class="external-link"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11869450.svg" alt="DOI" class="figure"></a></p>

author) then each one will start with a new - symbol.</p>

<p>A key feature of Github (as opposed to Git itself) is the issue
tracker. This provides us a place to keep track of any problems or bugs
in the code and to discuss them with other developers. Sometimes
advanced users will also use issue trackers of public projects to report
problems they are having (and sometimes this is misused by users seeking
help using documented features of the program).</p>
<p>In the testing chapter earlier on we identified a bug in our code
with missing values or date stamps failing (<strong><em>DOUBLE CHECK
THIS IS REALLY THE PROBLEM</em></strong>). Let’s go ahead and create a
new issue in our Github repository to describe this problem. We can find
the issue tracker on the “Issues” tab in the top left of the Github page
for the repository. Click on this and then click on the green “New
Issue” button on the right hand side of the screen. We can then enter a
title and description of our issue.</p>
<p>A good issue description should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the problem is, including any error messages that are
displayed.</li>
<li>What version of the software it occured with.</li>
<li>Any relevant information about the system running it, for example
the operating system being used.</li>
<li>Versions of any dependent libraries.</li>
<li>How to reproduce it.</li>

<p>Branching is a feature of Git that allows two or more parallel
streams of work. Commits can be made to one branch without interferring
with another. Branches are commonly used as a way for one developer to
work on a new feature or a bug fix while other developers work on other
features. When those new features or bug fixes are complete the branch
will be merged back with the main (sometimes called master) branch.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="creating-a-new-branch">Creating a new Branch<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-new-branch"></a>
</h3>
<p>New git branches are created with the <code>git branch</code>
command. This should be followed by the name of the branch to create. It
is common practice when the bug we are fixing has a corresponding issue
to name the branch after the issue number and name. For example we might
call the branch <code>01-missing-values-bug</code> instead of something
less descriptive like <code>bugfix</code>.</p>
<p>For example, the command:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb2">

</div>
<p>will create a new branch called <code>01-missing-values-bug</code>.
We can view the names of all the branches, by default there should be
one branch called <code>main</code> or perhaps <code>master</code> and
our new <code>01-missing-values-bug</code> branch. by running
<code>git branch</code> with no parameters. This will put <code>*</code>

<p>We can see that creating a new branch has not activated that branch.
To switch branches we can either use the <code>git switch</code> or
<code>git checkout</code> command followed by the branch name. For
example:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb5">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<p>To create a branch and change to it in a single command we can use
<code>git switch</code> with the <code>-c</code> option (or
<code>git checkout</code> with the <code>-b</code> option,
<code>git switch</code> is only found in more recent versions of
Git).</p>

<p>Once we have switched to a branch any further commits that are made
will go to that branch. When we run a <code>git commit</code> command
we’ll see the name of the branch we’re committing to in the output of

</h2>
<p>When we have completed working on a branch (for example fixing a bug)
then we can merge our branch back into the main one (or any other
branch). This is done with the <code>git merge</code> command.</p>
<p>This must be run on the <em>TARGET</em> branch of the merge, so we’ll
have to use a <code>git switch</code> command to set this.</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb15">

<p>Now we’re back on the main branch we can go ahead and merge the
changes from the bugfix branch:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb16">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pull-requests"></a>
</h2>
<p>On larger projects we might need to have a code review process before
changes are merged, especially before they are merged onto the main
branch that might be what is being released as the public version of the
software. Github has a process for this that it calls a “Pull Request”,
other Git services such as GitLab have different names for this, GitLab
calls them “Merge Requests”. Pull requests are where one developer
requests that another merge code from a branch (or “pull” it from
another copy of the repository). The person recveing the request then
has the chance to review the code, write comments suggesting changes or
even change the code themselves before merging it. It is also very
common for automated checks of code to be run on a pull request to
ensure the code is of good quality and is passing automated tests.</p>
<p>As a simple example of a pull request we can now create a pull
request for the changes we made on our
<code>01-missing-values-bug</code> branch and pushed to Github earlier
on. The Github webpage for our repository will now be saying something
like “bugfix had recent pushes n minutes ago - Compare &amp; Pull
request”. Click on this button and create a new pull request.</p>
<p>Give the pull request a title and write a brief description of it,
then click the green “Create pull request” button. Github will then
check if we can merge this pull request without any problems. We’ll look
at what to do when this isn’t possible later on.</p>
<p>There should be a green “Merge pull request” button, but if we click
on the down arrow inside this button there are three options on how to
handle this request:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a merge commit</li>
<li>Squash and merge</li>
<li>Rebase and merge</li>
</ol>
<p>The default is option 1, which will keep all of the commits made on
our branch intact. This can be useful for seeing the whole history of
our work, but if we’ve done a lot of minor edits or attempts at fixing a
problem to fix one bug it can be excessive to have all of this history
saved. This is where the second option comes in, this will place all of
our changes from the branch into just a single commit, this might be
much more obvious to other developers who will now see our bugfix as a
single commit in the history. The third option merges the branch
histories together in a different way that doesn’t make merges as
obvious, this can make the history easier to read but effectively
rewrites the commit history and will change the commit hash IDs. Some
projects that you contribute to might have their own rules about what
kind of merge they will prefer. For the purposes of this exercise we’ll
stick with the default merge commit.</p>
<p>Go ahead and click on “Merge pull request”, then “Confirm merge”. The
changes will now be merged together. Github gives us the option to
delete the branch we were working on, since it’s history is preserved in
the main branch there isn’t any reason to keep it.</p>

<h3 id="using-forks-instead-of-branches">Using Forks Instead of Branches<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-forks-instead-of-branches"></a>
</h3>
<p>A fork is similar to a branch, but instead of it being part of the
same repository it is a entirely new copy of the repository. Forks are
commonly used by Github users who wish to work on a project that they’re
not a member of. Typically forking will copy the repository to our own
namespace (e.g. github.com/username/reponame instead of
github.com/projectname/reponame)</p>
<p>To create a fork on github use the “Fork” button to the right of the
repository name. After we create our fork we can make some changes and
these could even be on the main branch inside our forked repository.
Github will track that a fork has been made displays a “Contribute”
button to create a pull request back to the original repository. Using
this we can request that the changes on our fork are incorporated by the
upstream project.</p>

page on your Github repository’s webpage, click on Collaborators from
the left hand menu and then click the green “Add People” button and
enter the Github username or email address of your partner. They will
get an email and an alert within Github to accept your invitation to
work on this repository, without doing this they won’t be able to access
it.</p>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
          g.async=true; g.src='https://cdn.matomo.cloud/carpentries.matomo.cloud/matomo.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
  </script>
