:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- A version control system is software that tracks and manages changes to a project over time
- Using version control aids reproducibility since the exact state of the software that produced an output can be recovered
- A commit represents the smallest unit of change to a project
- Branches are an integral part of the version control workflow since they separate stable work from developing work, and limit conflicts between collaborators
- Pull Requests are a mechanism to include changes into the stable branch after passing tests and code review
